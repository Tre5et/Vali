### Vali - create GeoGuessr locations like a pro

* Install .NET 8 runtime.
* dotnet tool install -g vali

### Commands
* `vali download --country "FR"` - Download data for France.
* `vali download` - Download data for all countries.
* `vali generate --file norway.json` - Generate locations based on specification in `norway.json`.
* `vali subdivisions --country "ES"` - Export default subdivision distribution data for Spain as JSON.
* `vali subdivisions --country "ES" --text` - Export default subdivision distribution data for Spain as text.
* `vali counties --country "NO"` - Export counties/municipalities data for Norway.

### Selecting countries
You need to specify which countries you want to include in the `countryCodes` array. Example:
```json
{
  "countryCodes": ["EC", "CO", "PE", "BO"]
}
```
### Distribution strategy
You can select between different strategies for distributing locations. Option 1 is `FixedCountByMaxMinDistance` where you specify how many locations you want in total and each subdivision will get their locations spread as far away from each other as possible. You can set a minimum minimum distance to set a lower limit on how close each location can be to each other. Example:
```json
{
  "distributionStrategy": {
    "key": "FixedCountByMaxMinDistance",
    "locationCountGoal": 45000,
    "minMinDistance": 200
  }
}
```

Option 2 is `MaxCountByFixedMinDistance` where you specify how far you want each location to be from each other in `FixedMinDistance` and it finds the maximum amount of locations *still upholding the subdivision distribution*. Example:
```json
{
  "distributionStrategy": {
    "key": "MaxCountByFixedMinDistance",
    "FixedMinDistance": 200
  }
}
```
### Specific country distribution
You can specify a country distribution of your choice. All numbers are relative (not representing location counts) and must be integers. Example:
```json
{
  "countryDistribution": {
    "NO": 200,
    "SE": 220,
    "FI": 200,
    "DK": 140
  }
}
```
### Specific subdivision distribution(s)
You can specify one or more subdivision distribution to override the default one(s). All numbers are relative (not representing location counts) and must be integers. You can output the default subdivision distribution as JSON with the command `vali subdivisions --country "NO"` (or `vali subdivisions --country "NO" --text` to get a textual representation) Example:
```json
{
  "subdivisionDistribution": {
    "NO": {
      "NO-03": 200,
      "NO-15": 1500
    },
    "SE": {
      "SE-AB": 1000,
      "SE-AC": 1500,
      "SE-BD": 2000
    }
  }
}
```
### Include or exclude subdivisions
Sometimes it can be handy to include or excludle a few subdivisions. F.ex. include only African Spain or exclude European TÃ¼rkiye. Examples:
```json
{
  "subdivisionInclusions": {
    "ES": [
      "ES-CN",
      "ES-CE",
      "ES-ML"
    ]
  }
}
```
```json
{
  "subdivisionExclusions": {
    "TR": [
      "TR-22",
      "TR-39",
      "TR-59",
      "TR-34"
    ]
  }
}
```
### Location filtering
Locations can be filtered globally, per country or per subdivision.

With these building blocks we can write queries/expressions to filter out certain locations. Some examples:

| Query                                             | Description

| `Year lte 2010`                                   | Gen2.
| `Roads200 eq 1 and Buildings200 eq 0`             | Rural coverage.
| `ClosestCoast lt 100`                             | Coastal coverage.
| `Buildings25 gte 3 and Buildings100 gte 6`        | Urban-ish coverage?
| `Surface eq 'gravel' or Surface eq 'fine_gravel'` | Gravel roads?

#### Filter locations globally
```json
{
  "globalLocationFilters": [
    "ClosestCoast lt 100 and Buildings100 gte 4"
  ]
}
```

#### Filter locations per country
```json
{
  "countryLocationFilters": {
    "GR": [
      "ClosestCoast lt 100 and Buildings100 gte 4"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Filter locations per subdivision
```json
{
  "countryLocationFilters": {
    "GR": {
      "GR-M": [
        "ClosestCoast lt 50"
      ],
      "GR-L": [
        "ClosestCoast lt 100"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Location preference filtering.
Sometimes you want a certain percentage of your map to contain one type of locations. Vali can help you try and achieve that. It's called preference filters and can be applied globally/per country or per subdivision. The filtering is applied *after* any location filtering as described above. Example showing how to achieve 25 % locations on unpaved roads and filling in the rest with any location:
```json
{
  "globalLocationPreferenceFilters": [
    {
      "expression": "Surface neq 'paved' and Surface neq 'asphalt'",
      "percentage": 25,
      "fill": false
    },
    {
      "expression": "*",
      "percentage": null,
      "fill": true
    }
  ]
}
```
```json
{
  "countryLocationPreferenceFilters": {
    "ES": [
      {
        "expression": "Surface neq 'paved' and Surface neq 'asphalt'",
        "percentage": 25,
        "fill": false
      },
      {
        "expression": "*",
        "percentage": null,
        "fill": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "subdivisionLocationPreferenceFilters": {
    "ES": {
      "ES-AN": [
        {
          "expression": "Surface neq 'paved' and Surface neq 'asphalt'",
          "percentage": 25,
          "fill": false
        },
        {
          "expression": "*",
          "percentage": null,
          "fill": true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
